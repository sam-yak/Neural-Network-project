# Neural-Network-project
In this project, I have completed key analyses including neural network training with performance monitoring through loss plots, prediction interval calculation using conformal inference, and a carefully chosen hypothesis test.

In this project, we have successfully executed the following key analyses:

1. **Neural Network Training**: We trained a neural network on the provided dataset. The training process was monitored and optimized by plotting the loss against each training iteration. This plot is included in the notebook, illustrating how the model's performance improved over time.

2. **Prediction Interval Using Conformal Inference**: We calculated a prediction interval using conformal inference. The results are accompanied by a detailed explanation, elucidating how this approach provides a statistical basis for the reliability of the predictions made by our model.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**: A specific hypothesis test was conducted, chosen based on the characteristics of our dataset and the objectives of our analysis. The notebook includes a comprehensive explanation of why this particular test was selected and an interpretation of the test results, providing insights into the statistical significance and implications of our findings.
